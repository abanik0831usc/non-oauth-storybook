### Intuit Widgets

Intuit widget **loads** the Aggregator experience with the following `queryParams`

```
https://aggregator-url.com?theme=theme&url=offeringUrl&isAuthScreenFirstInStack=isAuthScreenFirstInStack&shouldDisplayIntuitFooter=shouldDisplayIntuitFooter
```

### What are the query params?

| query | default | description | required
| :--- | :----: | :----: | :----:
| theme    |   -    |     Intuit offerings theme. Specific styling will be required by theme name | true
| url    |   -      | Intuit offerings URL where the request originated. Required to be pass in `window.postMessage` | true
| isAuthScreenFirstInStack    |   false    | Intuit has the option of starting the flow from Search & select screen or Authentication screen. In the case when a flow begins from Auth screen a flag `isAuthScreenFirstInStack` will be passed. This will be required to `hide` the `secondary` Back button on first screen | false
| shouldDisplayIntuitFooter    |   false    | Aggregators have the option of owning their own footer or have Intuit own the footer experience. By default, Aggregators owns the experience | false


# Style requirements

**Intuit** requires **aggregators** to set `margin` and `padding` to be set to **0**. **Intuit** will be handling these properties on their end.

**Intuit** requires **aggregators** to set `width` on the **container** to be set to **100%**. **Intuit** will be manage the `width` based on the offerings setting.

# Ownerships

**Intuit** will always own the **Provider banner/ Header** to display the **provider** information

**Aggregator** have the option to owning the **Footer** experience. The recommended approach is for aggregators to own them.


# How do I communicate with Intuit?

Intuit will be iframing the Aggregator window. Communication will be done via `window.postMessage`

# how Do I send message via post message?

```.jsx
const idxMessage = {
	...payload,
}
```

Aggregators have the option of sending the response as a `String` or as an `Object`.

To send it as a `String` - Aggregators are required to `stringify` the response:

```
JSON.stringify(idxMessage)
```

To send it as an `Object` - the response can be sent as is.

to `post` the message to the parent window:

```
window.parent.postMessage({ idxMessage }, url)
```

# Expected payload from Aggregator to Intuit

**NOTE** `enablePrimaryButton`, `primaryButtonContent` are only applicable when **Intuit** owns the footer experience.

### `Authentication` screen:

Intuit expects a payload (added below) when the form in the authentication screen is ready. This is expected when all the required fields are met. Similarly, if a form gets invalid, Intuit expects a payload which informs them the form is disabled to proceed.
